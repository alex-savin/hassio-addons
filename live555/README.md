# SmartHouse Hass.io Add-ons: Live555 RTSP Proxy Server

## About

[Live555 RTSP Proxy Server][live555] is a unicast RTSP server - built from the
"LIVE555 Streaming Media" software - that acts as a 'proxy' for one or more
'back-end' unicast or multicast RTSP/RTP streams (i.e., served by other server(s)).

The key feature of a proxy server is that it reads each 'back-end' stream only once, regardless of how many separate clients are streaming from the proxy server. This makes the proxy server ideal, for example, for streaming from a RTSP-enabled video camera (which might not be able to handle more than one connection at a time).
```
                                                              --> [RTSP client1]
        [back-end RTSP/RTP stream] --> [LIVE555 Proxy Server] --> [RTSP client2]
                                                              ...
                                                              --> [RTSP clientN]
```
Basic operation
The "LIVE555 Proxy Server" is a command-line (i.e., 'console') application. The simplest way to run it is to type:
```
        live555ProxyServer <url>
```
where <url> is a RTSP URL (i.e., beginning with "rtsp://") of a 'back-end' stream (e.g., from a video camera). 
After starting up, the server will display its own "rtsp://" URL for the proxy stream. RTSP clients can then use 
this URL to play (i.e., receive) the proxy stream.
The server can act as a proxy for many 'back-end' streams - not just one. If you enter more than one "rtsp://" URL 
on the command line, i.e.,
```
        live555ProxyServer <url1> <url2> ... <urlN>
```
then the server will - after starting up - display "rtsp://" URLs for proxying each one. (Of course, you should 
proxy multiple streams only if you have sufficient network bandwidth to receive all of them.)


This add-on is a port of Live555 RTSP Proxy Server to be able to run on Hass.io 
and is based on Alpine Linux and is using Docker.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

**NOTE**: Your Hass.io machine MUST HAVE a static IP for this add-on to function
properly/fully.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Live555 RTSP Proxy Server" add-on
1. Start the "Live555 RTSP Proxy Server" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Live555 RTSP Proxy Server" add-on to see it in action.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "streams": [
    "rtsp://[username]:[password]@[camera_ip]:[port]/[stream_uri]"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `streams`

This option allows you to a list of camera streams (e.g., point 
`rtsp://[username]:[password]@[camera_ip]:[port]/[stream_uri]`to the IP address of your camera stream).

See the example above this chapter for a more visual representation.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest picking a stronger/safer password instead of
using this option! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_
